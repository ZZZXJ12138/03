## 数据收集

The study participants were 120 active male soccer referees (between the ages 18 and 47) selected by the random sampling method from 250 soccer referees recruited from Turkey Football Federation living in Ankara. The referees on a special diet and not actively involved in the matches were excluded from the study. According to the level of refereeing, participants were classified as city and class referees from low to high. The match in which the referee’s control is classified as follows: city referees at the provincial level and class referees at the national level.

The general characteristics of subjects (such as age, educational status, classification and years of refereeing experience) and nutritional habits were recorded with the help of a questionnaire.

## 人体测量

Anthropometric measurements (body weight and height, fat mass (FM), waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference) were performed while subjects wearing underwear in a fasting state (12 h). Body weight and FM were measured using a multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analyzer (TANITAMC980, Japan, 0.1 kg accuracy)<sup>(13)</sup>. Height, WC and hip circumference were measured by the researchers according to proper methods<sup>(14)</sup>. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight/height<sup>2</sup>.

## 能量和营养摄入

Food consumption was assessed through a 24-hour recall method. The dietary recalls were performed through face-to-face interviews and a trained dietitian. A Turkish food photograph catalog was used to assist respondents in identifying the actual quantity of the foods<sup>(15)</sup>. Standard dishes description was used to estimate the amounts of food in one portion consumed outside the institutions<sup>(16)</sup>. Gram amounts of nutrients consumed were entered into the BEBIS-8 (Nutrition Information Systems Software) computer program and daily energy and other nutrients were analysed<sup>(17)</sup>. Nutrient intake below two-thirds of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) (<67 %) was considered low<sup>(18)</sup>.

## 运动表现评估

The soccer referees performed 5, 10 and 30 m sprint tests to measure speed and cooper test for physical fitness. Before the tests, all referees participated in a 20-minute warm-up workout. The sprint tests were practiced on the synthetic turf and performed twice. During the waiting times between tests, participants were kept active by jumping rope and stretching exercises to avoid cooling down. Sprint tests have similar protocols. The photocells settled the starting and finishing points of the distances 5, 10 and 30 m. All referees started from 1 m behind the starting photocell. The best scores of the referees were recorded.

The cooper test<sup>(19)</sup> was conducted at the 400 m synthetic athletics track. The referees ran the maximum distance they could cover in 12 min by the test protocol. The covered distance was measured with the help of markers located at 50 m intervals on the runway<sup>(20)</sup>.

## 统计分析

SPSS (version 23; IBM, Armonk, NY) package program was used for statistical analysis. Data were analysed via Kolmogorov–Smirnov or Shapiro–Wilks tests. Descriptive statistics were expressed using mean and standard deviation (mean ± SD) for continuous variables while frequency and percentages (%) for categorical variables. The significance was set at P < 0.05.
