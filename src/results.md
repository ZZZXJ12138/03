The participants’ general characteristics were grouped according to referee classification and shown in Table 1. The sample of the study consisted of 120 male soccer referees in different classifications (69 city and 51 class referee) with a mean age of 26.1 ± 4.51. The refereeing time was 4.51 ± 3.73 years for city referees and 7.00 ± 3.42 years for class referees (P < 0.05). Only 30.0 % of referees studied nutrition education during the education process, and most of them (68.3 %) stated that the source of their nutrition knowledge was TV-internet. The mean number of the main meal was higher in class referees than in city referees (2.80 ± 0.40 v. 2.49 ± 0.50) while the snack meal was higher in city referees than class referees (1.17 ± 0.92 v. 0.80 ± 0.89) (P < 0.05). It was determined that 59.2 % of referees skipped meals and the most skipped meal was lunch (31.7 %).

The anthropometric measurements according to classification are shown in Table 2. The higher mean values (excluding FM%) were determined in class referees. The differences in fat mass of city and class referees (14.1 ± 4.28 % v. 12.3 ± 4.41 %) were statistically significant (P < 0.05).

Table 3 shows the referees’ daily energy and nutrient intake and RDA (%). The mean total energy intake of referees was 2244 ± 734.19 kcal (2205 ± 649.09 and 2297 ± 839.59 kcal for city and class referees, respectively). It was found that 29.2 % of referees’ energy intakes were not meeting the recommended daily intake levels. Daily energy and nutrient intakes were similar (P > 0.05). Vitamin A and calcium were the nutrients in which recommended daily intake level was not met at the highest level (30.0 and 34.2 %, respectively). Carbohydrate, protein and fat intakes per body weight (kg) were determined as 3.51 ± 1.38, 1.23 ± 0.49 and 1.27 ± 0.57 g, respectively.

Soccer referees’ athletic test scores are shown in Table 4 and the relationship between these scores and anthropometric measurements is shown in Table 5. The athletic test scores of city referees were 2861 ± 195.18 m for the cooper test; 0.98 ± 0.05, 1.71 ± 0.07 and 4.29 ± 0.15 s for the 5, 10 and 30 m sprint tests, respectively. For class referees, these values are 3003 ± 144.32 m for the cooper test; 0.96 ± 0.05, 1.70 ± 0.07 and 4.22 ± 0.20 s for the 5, 10 and 30 m sprint tests, respectively. Differences between cooper test scores were statistically significant (P < 0.001) (Table 4). When all the participants were evaluated, it was found that a negative significant correlation between FM% and cooper test score (P < 0.01; r=−0.35), a positive significant correlation between FM% and 5, 10 and 30 m sprint test scores (P < 0.01, r = 0.38; P < 0.01, r = 0.38 and P < 0.01, r = 0.48, respectively). Similarly, there was a negative significant correlation between WC and cooper test score (P < 0.01; r =−0.31), a positive significant correlation between WC and 5, 10 and 30 m sprint test scores (P < 0.01, r = 0.33; P < 0.01, r = 0.40; P < 0.01, r = 0.33, respectively). Also, it was found that a positive significant correlation between waist-hip ratio and 5, 10 and 30 m sprint test scores (P < 0.01, r = 0.32; P < 0.01, r = 0.29 and P < 0.01, r = 0.21, respectively) (Table 5).
