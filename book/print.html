<p><strong>摘要</strong>：Nutrition plays an important role in improving sports performance. The present study aimed at nutritional assessment and examined the relationship between athletic performance and body composition in soccer referees at different levels. The study participants were 120 male soccer referees. 5, 10 and 30 metres (m) sprint tests to measure speed and cooper test for physical fitness were applied in the referees. Participants were divided into two groups as city and class soccer referee. The anthropometric measurements, excluding fat mass (FM) (%), were higher in class referees. Fat mass (%) differences (14.1 ± 4.28 vs 12.3 ± 4.41) were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). Daily energy and nutrient intakes were similar. The inadequacy percentages of energy, vitamin A and calcium were the highest (29.2, 30.0 and 34.2 %, respectively). It was found that a negative significant correlation between FM% and cooper test score (P &lt; 0.01; r = −0.35), a positive significant correlation between FM% and 5, 10 and 30 m sprint test scores (P &lt; 0.01, r = 0.38; P &lt; 0.01, r = 0.38 and P &lt; 0.01, r = 0.48, respectively). Similarly, there was a negative significant correlation between waist circumference (WC) and cooper test score (P &lt; 0.01; r = −0.31), a positive significant correlation between WC and 5, 10 and 30 m sprint test scores (P &lt; 0.01, r = 0.33; P &lt; 0.01, r = 0.40; P &lt; 0.01, r = 0.33, respectively). Nutritional recommendations for soccer referees should be made specific to the individual, considering body composition, training intensity and match frequency by a dietician.</p>

<p>Soccer referees are a specific group of athletes whose careers reach the highest level between 30 and 45<sup>(1)</sup>. They are considered athletes because following regular and intensive training programmes to have a high level of performance<sup>(2)</sup>. They must have excellent refereeing knowledge, good communication skills and ensure good emotional control for successful match management<sup>(3)</sup>. As with all other sports, referees must have an optimal fitness level to perform a good performance<sup>(4)</sup>.</p>
<p>For elite athletes, nutritional strategies have become important in their physical condition and training. The referee’s performance is influenced by factors such as physical training, eating behaviours and body composition<sup>(1)</sup>. Diet quality affects body composition<sup>(5)</sup>. To maintain and improve their performance, soccer referees are recommended to consume a highquality diet, to have optimal body composition. Determining the required intake amounts in terms of energy, macro and micronutrients is essential. A limited number of studies examine soccer referees’ nutritional behaviour. Teixeira <em>et al</em>.<sup>(6)</sup> found that the referees’ carbohydrate intake was below the recommended level and they were malnourished in terms of micronutrients. Another study stated that dietary energy from carbohydrates was not sufficient when considering
their work<sup>(4)</sup>.</p>
<p>Soccer referees have a maximum oxygen uptake of 51.9 ml/ kg/min and perform similarly to soccer players covering a distance of approximately 10 000–13 000 metres (m) throughout the match<sup>(7,8)</sup>. While there are guidelines<sup>(9)</sup> for athlete nutrition, there is no guideline for soccer referees. Referees who are on average 15 years older than elite athletes should not be ignored when it comes to proper nutrition recommendations. Today, elite soccer referees are given nutritional recommendations similar to those of soccer players, regardless of differences in age, type of activity, body composition and physical condition<sup>(10)</sup>. Optimal body composition enables athletes to move more effectively during training and competitions<sup>(11,12)</sup>. Therefore, it is important to assess the nutritional status and determine the relationship between body composition and athletic performance in soccer referees. The present study aimed at nutritional assessment and examined the relationship between athletic performance and body composition in soccer referees at different levels.</p>

<h2 id="数据收集"><a class="header" href="#数据收集">数据收集</a></h2>
<p>The study participants were 120 active male soccer referees (between the ages 18 and 47) selected by the random sampling method from 250 soccer referees recruited from Turkey Football Federation living in Ankara. The referees on a special diet and not actively involved in the matches were excluded from the study. According to the level of refereeing, participants were classified as city and class referees from low to high. The match in which the referee’s control is classified as follows: city referees at the provincial level and class referees at the national level.</p>
<p>The general characteristics of subjects (such as age, educational status, classification and years of refereeing experience) and nutritional habits were recorded with the help of a questionnaire.</p>
<h2 id="人体测量"><a class="header" href="#人体测量">人体测量</a></h2>
<p>Anthropometric measurements (body weight and height, fat mass (FM), waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference) were performed while subjects wearing underwear in a fasting state (12 h). Body weight and FM were measured using a multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analyzer (TANITAMC980, Japan, 0.1 kg accuracy)<sup>(13)</sup>. Height, WC and hip circumference were measured by the researchers according to proper methods<sup>(14)</sup>. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight/height<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<h2 id="能量和营养摄入"><a class="header" href="#能量和营养摄入">能量和营养摄入</a></h2>
<p>Food consumption was assessed through a 24-hour recall method. The dietary recalls were performed through face-to-face interviews and a trained dietitian. A Turkish food photograph catalog was used to assist respondents in identifying the actual quantity of the foods<sup>(15)</sup>. Standard dishes description was used to estimate the amounts of food in one portion consumed outside the institutions<sup>(16)</sup>. Gram amounts of nutrients consumed were entered into the BEBIS-8 (Nutrition Information Systems Software) computer program and daily energy and other nutrients were analysed<sup>(17)</sup>. Nutrient intake below two-thirds of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) (&lt;67 %) was considered low<sup>(18)</sup>.</p>
<h2 id="运动表现评估"><a class="header" href="#运动表现评估">运动表现评估</a></h2>
<p>The soccer referees performed 5, 10 and 30 m sprint tests to measure speed and cooper test for physical fitness. Before the tests, all referees participated in a 20-minute warm-up workout. The sprint tests were practiced on the synthetic turf and performed twice. During the waiting times between tests, participants were kept active by jumping rope and stretching exercises to avoid cooling down. Sprint tests have similar protocols. The photocells settled the starting and finishing points of the distances 5, 10 and 30 m. All referees started from 1 m behind the starting photocell. The best scores of the referees were recorded.</p>
<p>The cooper test<sup>(19)</sup> was conducted at the 400 m synthetic athletics track. The referees ran the maximum distance they could cover in 12 min by the test protocol. The covered distance was measured with the help of markers located at 50 m intervals on the runway<sup>(20)</sup>.</p>
<h2 id="统计分析"><a class="header" href="#统计分析">统计分析</a></h2>
<p>SPSS (version 23; IBM, Armonk, NY) package program was used for statistical analysis. Data were analysed via Kolmogorov–Smirnov or Shapiro–Wilks tests. Descriptive statistics were expressed using mean and standard deviation (mean ± SD) for continuous variables while frequency and percentages (%) for categorical variables. The significance was set at P &lt; 0.05.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="研究结果"><a class="header" href="#研究结果">研究结果</a></h1>
<p>The participants’ general characteristics were grouped according to referee classification and shown in Table 1. The sample of the study consisted of 120 male soccer referees in different classifications (69 city and 51 class referee) with a mean age of 26.1 ± 4.51. The refereeing time was 4.51 ± 3.73 years for city referees and 7.00 ± 3.42 years for class referees (P &lt; 0.05). Only 30.0 % of referees studied nutrition education during the education process, and most of them (68.3 %) stated that the source of their nutrition knowledge was TV-internet. The mean number of the main meal was higher in class referees than in city referees (2.80 ± 0.40 v. 2.49 ± 0.50) while the snack meal was higher in city referees than class referees (1.17 ± 0.92 v. 0.80 ± 0.89) (P &lt; 0.05). It was determined that 59.2 % of referees skipped meals and the most skipped meal was lunch (31.7 %).</p>
<p>The anthropometric measurements according to classification are shown in Table 2. The higher mean values (excluding FM%) were determined in class referees. The differences in fat mass of city and class referees (14.1 ± 4.28 % v. 12.3 ± 4.41 %) were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05).</p>
<p>Table 3 shows the referees’ daily energy and nutrient intake and RDA (%). The mean total energy intake of referees was 2244 ± 734.19 kcal (2205 ± 649.09 and 2297 ± 839.59 kcal for city and class referees, respectively). It was found that 29.2 % of referees’ energy intakes were not meeting the recommended daily intake levels. Daily energy and nutrient intakes were similar (P &gt; 0.05). Vitamin A and calcium were the nutrients in which recommended daily intake level was not met at the highest level (30.0 and 34.2 %, respectively). Carbohydrate, protein and fat intakes per body weight (kg) were determined as 3.51 ± 1.38, 1.23 ± 0.49 and 1.27 ± 0.57 g, respectively.</p>
<p>Soccer referees’ athletic test scores are shown in Table 4 and the relationship between these scores and anthropometric measurements is shown in Table 5. The athletic test scores of city referees were 2861 ± 195.18 m for the cooper test; 0.98 ± 0.05, 1.71 ± 0.07 and 4.29 ± 0.15 s for the 5, 10 and 30 m sprint tests, respectively. For class referees, these values are 3003 ± 144.32 m for the cooper test; 0.96 ± 0.05, 1.70 ± 0.07 and 4.22 ± 0.20 s for the 5, 10 and 30 m sprint tests, respectively. Differences between cooper test scores were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001) (Table 4). When all the participants were evaluated, it was found that a negative significant correlation between FM% and cooper test score (P &lt; 0.01; r=−0.35), a positive significant correlation between FM% and 5, 10 and 30 m sprint test scores (P &lt; 0.01, r = 0.38; P &lt; 0.01, r = 0.38 and P &lt; 0.01, r = 0.48, respectively). Similarly, there was a negative significant correlation between WC and cooper test score (P &lt; 0.01; r =−0.31), a positive significant correlation between WC and 5, 10 and 30 m sprint test scores (P &lt; 0.01, r = 0.33; P &lt; 0.01, r = 0.40; P &lt; 0.01, r = 0.33, respectively). Also, it was found that a positive significant correlation between waist-hip ratio and 5, 10 and 30 m sprint test scores (P &lt; 0.01, r = 0.32; P &lt; 0.01, r = 0.29 and P &lt; 0.01, r = 0.21, respectively) (Table 5).</p>
